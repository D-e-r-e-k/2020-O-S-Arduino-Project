# Handwriter
Handwriter is a concept developed by Dewen Zhang and YoungRok Lee to remind people of handwriting's value and communication beyond language.
## Ideation
Information Theory has pretty much provided a solution for communicating any vectorized information. However, screen-based communication methods we have now only cover very limited dimensions. We believed that language is able to document most information during a conversation, before revealing the importance of [nonverbal communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication). Our concepts are centered around the idea of inspiring audiences to pay attention to aspects of communication that are important but didnâ€™t receive much attention.
## Concept
Our concept centers around hand writing. Scientific research told us during face to face communication, only 7 to 30 percent of information is transmitted through language. When we are texting however, only language is delivered. We believe every detail in the process of writing down a sentence such as the hand written font, pauses and hesitations, and mistakes all has a meaning. The device we are creating aims to record as much detail in hand writing as possible, then recreate the process of writing the message down to the receiver.

## Prototype
We created a "Wizard of Oz" style prototype to present our concept.
### Writing Mechanism
Our writing mechanism as adapted from

We 3D printed all the parts, sanded them, and put them together.

### Recording Mechanism
Our recording mechanism by servomotor is inspired by
