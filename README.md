# 2020-O-S-Arduino-Project
This is a repo for 2020 Fall Object and Space Arduino Project with Gregory Cowley.

In the not so distant past, communication was limited to either a letter or a phone call. Phones were wired to the wall. If you were lucky, you had an answering machine. A cordless phone that you walk freely around the house was the peak of technology. If you were expecting an important call, you had to stay home and wait. Communication was never certain or instantaneous.
<br>
Today we have mobile phones with email and instant messaging. Social media has turned communication into a constant stream rather than a specific event. We are always connected, and being "unavailable" is rare. You're either on a plane or hiking deep in the woods when you're able to unplug.
<br>
Our current remote communication does have limits, though. We are limited to screens, keyboards, and devices. These are the current paradigm. Whereas 30 years ago, the wall-mounted phone and postal service were the dominant paradigms. 
<br>
For this project, we will be doing a thought experiment. What if we didn't have (or need) screens, keyboards, or devices? Imagine it's 30 years in the future, and these technical constraints are antiquated. We have a new and better way's to communicate. Imagine that we can engage the senses rather than just the eyes and fingertips.
<br>
There will be a real prototype component of this project. One built on today's technology. This will be the Arduino open-source microcontroller system.

>PROCESS:
<br>
We will split up into pairs. Each pair will work on communication language and mechanism. A message will be sent from one member to another via the internet. In turn, a response will be sent back. Not unlike instant messaging, but no screens are devices will be involved.
<br>
From the very start, we will be creating a digital notebook that will be turned in at the end. This will include:
>- Create a narrative. A story around the communication that is about to take place.
>- Research our current tools and theoretical ideas. Collect links, videos, images, etc.
>- Brainstorm through sketches.
>- Distill three ideas to propose to the class.
>- Iterate these ideas along with feedback down to one idea.
>- Give this idea a physical form.
>- Choose the electronics you will use.
>- Create the software that will drive the experience.
>- User test your products.
>- Iterate and complete the project.


>TOOLS:
<br>
>- The Hosyond Arduino kit will form the basis for the electronics.
>- Use any modeling tool or technique you like for the prototype packaging.
>- We'll use C++ and the limited subset for Arduino to program the project.
>- Internet connection will be achieved through WiFi using the ESP8266.
>- https://socket.800rpm.com/ will be our connection point. It is a WebSocket that allows communication between any two global points in realtime.


>DELIVERABLES:
<br>
>- Your digital notes.
>- DEMO video of your communication.
